## Generative AI in the Enterprise as a Co-Worker for Tech Support (Google-sponsored Dissertation)
I developed a hybrid AI-human model utilising the OODA loop framework, which significantly improved decision-making, response times, and customer satisfaction in tech support. To enhance transparency and trust, I applied explainable AI methodologies like LIME, promoting effective collaboration between AI systems and support engineers. In partnership with Google, I refined data schemas and AI models, applying machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines to automate and optimise tech support tasks

- **Technologies Used:** _Python, machine learning, XAI_

## Movie Recommendation System
In this project, I employed a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to develop an advanced system using the IMDb dataset aimed at enhancing user experience by providing personalised movie recommendations. The project focused on integrating multiple AI models including collaborative filtering algorithms like cosine similarity, K-Nearest Neighbors, and advanced matrix factorisation methods like Singular Value Decomposition and neural network approaches like Neural Collaborative Filtering. Additionally, the system utilised content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their attributes, and hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. I implemented these models to analyse user behaviour and preferences effectively, managing to handle large datasets and improve recommendation accuracy as shown through metrics such as RMSE, MAE, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project highlighted my capabilities in handling complex AI algorithms and large datasets, contributing to a better understanding of user preferences in digital media consumption.

## Data Processing and Analytics
For this project, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing a multifaceted database system from an initial Entity-Relationship model to its realisation in SQL, MongoDB, and Neo4J, focused on art gallery management. My responsibilities included crafting and evaluating numerous SQL and MongoDB test cases to ensure database functionality, enhancing data retrieval efficiency, and system robustness. Additionally, I applied advanced machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and random forests, to analyse datasets, performed feature selection, and employed PCA for dimensionality reduction, which significantly optimized model performance. My active participation in team discussions and detailed report documentation ensured that the project met academic standards and facilitated effective knowledge transfer.

## Multiple-Objective Routing Path Optimisation
The goal is to find optimal routing paths from cars to base stations at either end of a motorway. The objectives are to maximise end-to-end data transmission rate and minimise end-to-end latency. The project employs Dijkstra’s and Genetic optimisation algorithms

## A Blockchain-Based Approach for Enhancing Digital Identity Security and Privacy in Healthcare
In this project, a blockchain-based solution was proposed to enhance the security and management of digital identities and consent for patient data in the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Blockchain features like decentralisation, cryptography, smart contracts, and self-sovereign identity were utilised to distribute patient records securely across nodes instead of relying on centralised databases. Smart contracts enabled patients to grant and revoke consent for healthcare providers to access specific parts of their medical data, giving patients control over their information. The solution also integrated self-sovereign identity to provide patients with exclusive ownership of their medical credentials, reducing the risks of identity theft. Additional security measures like encryption, digital signatures, and consensus algorithms further strengthened the system's resilience against cyber threats and data tampering.

## Constructor Robot Given a Map of Buildings
The project's primary goal is to create structures of various heights using the provided building map. The height of each building on the map is determined by using image processing methods. This building map is created by a constructor robot using objects of the same height. An image of a construction map shows the amount of buildings that are next to one another along with the height information for each structure. The output is a visual display of this map, which is formed by this map being examined with image processing methods. Information about the map including the number of structures and their related heights are forwarded to the construction. A constructor robot that can carry objects and stack them on top of one another using the given map is built. Three objects are stacked on top of one another to create a building with three floors, as each object symbolises one level. All of the buildings are visible to the robot
