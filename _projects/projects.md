# Projects

## Generative AI in the Enterprise as a Co-Worker for Tech Support (Google-sponsored Dissertation)
**Description:** I developed a hybrid AI-human model utilising the OODA loop framework, which significantly improved decision-making, response times, and customer satisfaction in tech support. To enhance transparency and trust, I applied explainable AI methodologies like LIME, promoting effective collaboration between AI systems and support engineers. In partnership with Google, I refined data schemas and AI models, applying machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines to automate and optimise tech support tasks

- **Technologies Used:** _Python, machine learning, XAI_

## Movie Recommendation System
**Description:** In this project, I employed a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to develop an advanced system using the IMDb dataset aimed at enhancing user experience by providing personalised movie recommendations. The project focused on integrating multiple AI models including collaborative filtering algorithms like cosine similarity, K-Nearest Neighbors, and advanced matrix factorisation methods like Singular Value Decomposition and neural network approaches like Neural Collaborative Filtering. Additionally, the system utilised content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their attributes, and hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. I implemented these models to analyse user behaviour and preferences effectively, managing to handle large datasets and improve recommendation accuracy as shown through metrics such as RMSE, MAE, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project highlighted my capabilities in handling complex AI algorithms and large datasets, contributing to a better understanding of user preferences in digital media consumption.

- **Technologies Used:** _Python, Data Analysis, PyTorch, Surprise, Tensorflow, Machine Learning_
