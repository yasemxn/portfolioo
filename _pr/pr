<b> Generative AI in the Enterprise as a Co-Worker for Tech Support (Google-sponsored Dissertation) </b> <br/>
_June 2024 - September 2024_ <br/>
I developed a hybrid AI-human model utilising the OODA loop framework, which significantly improved decision-making, response times, and customer satisfaction in tech support. To enhance transparency and trust, I applied explainable AI methodologies like LIME, promoting effective collaboration between AI systems and support engineers. In partnership with Google, I refined data schemas and AI models, applying machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines to automate and optimise tech support tasks.<br/>

<b> Movie Recommendation System</b> <br/>
_March 2024 - May 2024_ <br/>

In this project, I employed a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to develop an advanced system using the IMDb dataset aimed at enhancing user experience by providing personalised movie recommendations. The project focused on integrating multiple AI models including collaborative filtering algorithms like cosine similarity, K-Nearest Neighbors, and advanced matrix factorisation methods like Singular Value Decomposition and neural network approaches like Neural Collaborative Filtering. Additionally, the system utilised content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their attributes, and hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. I implemented these models to analyse user behaviour and preferences effectively, managing to handle large datasets and improve recommendation accuracy as shown through metrics such as RMSE, MAE, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project highlighted my capabilities in handling complex AI algorithms and large datasets, contributing to a better understanding of user preferences in digital media consumption.

<b> Data Processing and Analytics</b> <br/>
_March 2024 - May 2024_ <br/>

For this project, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing a multifaceted database system from an initial Entity-Relationship model to its realization in SQL, MongoDB, and Neo4J, focused on art gallery management. My responsibilities included crafting and evaluating numerous SQL and MongoDB test cases to ensure database functionality, enhancing data retrieval efficiency, and system robustness. Additionally, I applied advanced machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and random forests, to analyse datasets, performed feature selection, and employed PCA for dimensionality reduction, which significantly optimized model performance. My active participation in team discussions and detailed report documentation ensured that the project met academic standards and facilitated effective knowledge transfer.

<b> A Blockchain-Based Approach for Enhancing Digital Identity Security and Privacy in Healthcare</b> <br/>
_October 2023 - January 2024_ <br/>

In this project, a blockchain-based solution was proposed to enhance the security and management of digital identities and consent for patient data in the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Blockchain features like decentralisation, cryptography, smart contracts, and self-sovereign identity were utilised to distribute patient records securely across nodes instead of relying on centralised databases. Smart contracts enabled patients to grant and revoke consent for healthcare providers to access specific parts of their medical data, giving patients control over their information. The solution also integrated self-sovereign identity to provide patients with exclusive ownership of their medical credentials, reducing the risks of identity theft. Additional security measures like encryption, digital signatures, and consensus algorithms further strengthened the system's resilience against cyber threats and data tampering.

<b> Constructor Robot Given a Map of Buildings </b> <br/>
_November 2022 - June 2023_ <br/>

The project's primary goal is to create structures of various heights using the provided building map. The height of each building on the map is determined by using image processing methods. This building map is created by a constructor robot using objects of the same height. An image of a construction map shows the amount of buildings that are next to one another along with the height information for each structure. The output is a visual display of this map, which is formed by this map being examined with image processing methods. Information about the map including the number of structures and their related heights are forwarded to the construction. A constructor robot that can carry objects and stack them on top of one another using the given map is built. Three objects are stacked on top of one another to create a building with three floors, as each object symbolises one level. All of the buildings are visible to the robot. <br/>

<b> Reader - Writer Problem </b> <br/>
_October 2021 - January 2022_ <br/>

A solution to readers-writers problem in which several processes (readers and writers) are trying to access shared variables. If two readers access the shared data simultaneously, no adverse effects will result, hence, they are allowed to access. However, if a writer and some other process (either a reader or a writer) access the data simultaneously, chaos may ensue. To ensure that these difficulties do not arise, we require that the writers have exclusive access to the shared data while writing to the data. <br/>

<b> P2P File Sharing Application </b> <br/>
_April 2021 - May 2021_ <br/>

The project is about designing and implementing a peer-to-peer file sharing application with Python 3. There are four processes: Chunk_Announcer which connects to the Local Area Network,every peer starts to periodically broadcast the list of all files they have. Chunk_Discovery after connecting to the LAN, every node also starts listening for peers announcements. Upon hearing an announcement, the contents are stored in a local dictionary of “which users have which files”. Chunk_Downloader , in this process the end user specifies a content to download, and the downloading process looks up its local dictionary to see which users have the chunks of that content. Then it launches TCP sessions with the users that hold subparts of the requested file, to download all subparts of that file. and lastly Chunk_Uploader will receive the requested content via TCP connection and it will be downloaded both as chunks and as a merged file. Thanks to this project, i have a better understanding of how a network application operates and what are the technologies behind it. <br/>
