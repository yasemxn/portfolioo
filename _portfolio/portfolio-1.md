title: "Generative AI in the Enterprise as a Co-Worker for Tech Support (Google-sponsored Dissertation)"
excerpt: "I developed a hybrid AI-human model utilising the OODA loop framework, which significantly improved decision-making, response times, and customer satisfaction in tech support. To enhance transparency and trust, I applied explainable AI methodologies like LIME, promoting effective collaboration between AI systems and support engineers. In partnership with Google, I refined data schemas and AI models, applying machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines to automate and optimise tech support tasks.'>"
